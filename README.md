#  MOTIVATION

The web has become a crucial technology for sharing information and connecting with the masses. In the same manner, e-commerce has become a must for businesses to connect with customers, find new customers, advertise, and for overall ease of business. Our country is also on the path and many e-commerce businesses and technology startups are blooming. So to cater to the needs and improve and contribute to the technology, we have built an e-commerce website. We have made an easy-to-use, effective, improved, and dynamic website [3] that is able to serve the needs of actual businesses. With this project, we have also enhanced our skills in website building and web development and related technologies, development languages, and frameworks. We also got ideas about solving real-life problems and explored more ways to solve them.
